Tu agenda llena es tu dopamina, no tu negocio.

ACCEPTED:
[A_retry] 0.520 | A packed calendar feels productive. It's not. It's just noise you're confusing for progress.

REJECTED:
[A] 0.476 | A packed calendar feels like progress. It's not. It's avoidance with scheduling software. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[A] 0.429 | Your calendar is full because saying yes is easier than deciding what actually matters. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[A] 0.452 | Busy schedules are dopamine hits disguised as work. Your business grows in the gaps you refuse to fill. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[B] 0.470 | Your packed schedule is your dopamine fix, not your business. Real growth comes from focused, strategic action, not busywork. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[B] 0.448 | A full agenda might feel good, but it’s a distraction. Your business needs clear, intentional moves, not just activity. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[B] 0.456 | Don’t confuse a busy calendar with progress. Your business thrives on strategic focus, not a dopamine-fueled to-do list. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[A_retry] 0.426 | Your calendar is full because saying yes feels like momentum. It isn't. You're just avoiding the harder work that has no meeting invite. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[A_retry] 0.414 | Busy schedules are a drug. They let you feel important while your actual business starves for attention. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[B_retry] 0.440 | Your packed schedule is your dopamine hit, not your business. Make sure your to-do list serves your goals, not just your addiction to busy. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[B_retry] 0.444 | A full agenda is a drug. It feels good, but it’s not the same as building a real business. Focus on what moves the needle, not what fills your day. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[B_retry] 0.410 | Your jam-packed calendar is your dopamine, not your growth. Prioritize what actually scales your business, not just what keeps you busy. || too_generic_sim<0.50

=== IDEA ===
Si todo es urgente, nadie sabe qué es importante.

ACCEPTED:
[A] 0.505 | When everything screams for attention, nothing actually matters. Priority is the art of saying no to 47 things so one thing can breathe.
[A] 0.543 | The inbox that marks everything urgent has trained you to treat nothing as important. Delete the noise or drown in it.
[B] 0.557 | If everything is urgent, no one knows what's actually important. Prioritize or drown in noise.
[B] 0.566 | If all tasks are urgent, you've failed to set clear priorities. Importance gets lost in the chaos.

REJECTED:
[A] 0.490 | You don't have an execution problem. You have a clarity problem. Real urgency doesn't need to announce itself. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[B] 0.467 | When everything is marked as urgent, you lose the ability to distinguish what truly matters. Clarity is key. || too_generic_sim<0.50

Delega entregables, no responsabilidad.

ACCEPTED:
- None

REJECTED:
[A] 0.329 | You can hand off the deck, the code, the campaign. You can't hand off caring when it breaks. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[A] 0.447 | Delegate the work. Own the outcome. If you try to delegate both, you're just creating expensive blame. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[A] 0.360 | Someone else can build it. Someone else can ship it. But when it fails at 2am, it's still your problem. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[B] 0.320 | Delega entregables, no responsabilidad. Clear deliverables keep everyone focused on what matters: results. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[B] 0.367 | When you delegate, make it about the deliverables, not the responsibility. It's about outputs, not ownership. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[B] 0.399 | Delegation is an art. Focus on the deliverables, not the responsibility. Results over roles. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[A_retry] 0.371 | You can delegate the deck, the demo, the deployment. You can't delegate caring when it breaks at 2am. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[A_retry] 0.416 | Hand off the task. Keep the outcome. If you give away both, you're not delegating—you're abdicating. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[A_retry] 0.394 | Delegation means someone else does the work. The failure is still yours. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[B_retry] 0.400 | Delegating tasks is easy. Delegating responsibility is the real challenge. Make sure your team owns the outcome, not just the to-do list. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[B_retry] 0.362 | Hand over the deliverables, but keep the accountability. Your team needs to feel the weight of ownership to truly excel. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[B_retry] 0.373 | When you delegate, don't just pass the workload—pass the responsibility. Ownership drives results, not just completion. || too_generic_sim<0.50

El funnel roto casi nunca es tráfico, es onboarding.

ACCEPTED:
- None

REJECTED:
[A] 0.405 | You don't have a traffic problem. You have an onboarding problem. Fix the leak before you turn up the faucet. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[A] 0.373 | Most broken funnels aren't starved for users. They're bleeding them in the first three minutes. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[A] 0.326 | If half your signups ghost after day one, buying more ads is just paying to watch people leave faster. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[B] 0.366 | The broken funnel is rarely about traffic. It's almost always the onboarding. Fix the onboarding, and the traffic will convert. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[B] 0.362 | When your funnel is leaking, don't blame the traffic. The problem is almost always in the onboarding process. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[B] 0.447 | Most founders focus on traffic when their funnel is broken. But the real issue is usually the onboarding. Nail that, and watch your numbers soar. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[A_retry] 0.309 | Your funnel isn't broken because nobody's clicking. It's broken because the people who do click have no idea what to do next. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[A_retry] 0.371 | You're spending thousands on traffic to a product nobody knows how to use. Fix onboarding before you buy another ad. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[A_retry] 0.423 | Most founders optimize acquisition when the real leak is between signup and understanding what the hell they just signed up for. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[B_retry] 0.390 | The broken funnel is rarely about traffic. It's almost always the onboarding. Fix the first step, and the rest follows. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[B_retry] 0.364 | Don't blame your traffic for a broken funnel. The real culprit is usually a flawed onboarding process. Nail that, and watch conversions soar. || too_generic_sim<0.50
[B_retry] 0.379 | When your funnel is leaking, it's not the traffic that's the problem. It's the onboarding. Make the first steps smooth, and you'll retain more users. || too_generic_sim<0.50
